# State Pattern

The state pattern is used in computer programming to encapsulate varying behavior for the same object, based on its internal state. This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to conditional statements and thus improve maintainability.

## When to use

- When you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state

## Programming Scenario

- Component lifecycle
- Finite state machine

## Pitfalls

- More classes => more code
